	<h2 class="col-eight shift-two">Overview</h2>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">Short term project for concierge service Icarus. The design of the site was crafted from the original brand identity, designed by Alex Reed.</p>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">The primary goal for the site was to show a stylish and high class service, that would act as a holding page that we could expand upon and grow with them over time.</p>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">A short video was created to showcase the tone of Icarus offering, to be played on the home page of the website to give people an introductory feel to the company.</p>

	<h2 class="col-eight shift-two">UX Process</h2>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">The user experience process was quite a simple one, being that the site could primarily sit on a single page. Quite a lot of information was required to be presented on one page however, including functionality such as a membership application form, carousels, video &amp; fixed imagery.</p>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">As requirements changed clientside, we adapted existing layouts and included new sections such as membership variant information to co-incide with the businesses changing KPI's.</p>

	<h2 class="col-eight shift-two">UI Design &amp; Front-end development</h2>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">Site design was completed for a responsive approach, mobile first. Designs were constructed for mobile, tablet and desktop, with an emphasis on functionality on breakpoints over 768px.</p>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">When it came to developing the site, we used the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask Python microframework</a> due to it's simplicity and versatility. We knew that at a later date we would be building in a members back-end system and the ability to purchase a membership through the website, and Flask allows this flexibility with ease.</p>

	<h2 class="col-eight shift-two">Future development</h2>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">Currently we are working to create a new product for Icarus that will work seamlessly with an iPhone app and companion Apple Watch application. The goal of this product is to give customers of Icarus a service which they can interface directly with when they want something, at a tap.</p>
