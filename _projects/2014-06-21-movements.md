		<p>Movements was a project initiated by <a href="http://www.advancinghumanrights.org">Advancing Human Rights</a> which we worked on full service from brand concept and ideation through to completion of the web application. We worked with the developers at <a href="http://guerillasoftware.net">Guerilla Software</a> to create a complex and security dependant system, which was a great challenge, but one that has yielded a rewarding experience working with the <a href="http://www.advancinghumanrights.org">Advancing Human Rights</a> group.</p>
		<p>Given a larger deadline, we would have had a chance to polish, along side the developers, the Movements.org platform and perfect their brand strategy</p>
		<p>Movements as a platform was recently picked up and mentioned as a force for good on both Al Jazeera and Fox news in America.</p>
