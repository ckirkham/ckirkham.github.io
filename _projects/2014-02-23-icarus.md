		<p>Short term project for a concierge service. The design of the site was crafted from the original brand identity, designed by Alex Reed.</p>
		<p>The primary goals for the site were to show a stylish and high class service.</p>
		<p>A short video was created to showcase the tone of the Icarus offering. This was to be played on the home page of the website to give people an introductory feel to the company.</p>
