		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Compare the Market came to us and asked us to plot a strategy for their service online, focusing on the question "How will we stay relevant in 5 years?".</p>
		<p>Working within a lean group, we came up with a conceptual idea and plan using modern and upcoming technology to create an integrated service experience. From your home, car and any technology that may interface directly with The Internet of Things, that could be made to make your life easier by managing it all through the Meerkat app.</p>

	<h2 class="col-eight shift-two">UX Process</h2>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">Research on target audiences was conducted and information gathered from previous projects we had done for Compare the Market. This saved time and provided valuable insights into existing metrics.</p>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">After collating all of this, we could set about a plan of where we would conceptually see Compare the Market developing in the near future to complete with the likes of Google et al who are venturing into comparison services also.</p>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">Sitemaps were sketched, and constructed, flows worked out and eventually we settled on an iPad application that we saw scaling with the technology advances. The app integrates with services currently in your home such as Nest thermostat and directly with your car. By managing all of your policies through the application and linking smart objects such as these, your premiums can dynamically alter themselves, providing you the best and most accurate insurance policies and claims.</p>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">Some features such as CarPlay integration and Android Smartwatch were not fully explored due to project time constraints, but their implications archived for the future.</p>

	<h2 class="col-eight shift-two">Meerkat iPad App UI</h2>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">After creating the strategy and sketching up what our digital hub was going to look like, we quickly moved onto visual design for the iPad app. A new brand language of iconography and colour systems were incorporated to keep Meerkat a seperate entity to the existing Compare the Market offering.</p>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">User stories were designed step by step to show user progression from the hub of the app into their individual policies, and to showcase how to claim, get information, and submit information into the various screen states.</p>

	<h2 class="col-eight shift-two">Final word</h2>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">By gamifying the profile completion of the app, we could cross-sell into different product avenues that Compare the Market are offering, requiring much less information submission and time sink for policy comparisons to be carried out at a later date.</p>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">Friendly copywriting mixed with simple calls to action made this a friendly conversational UI that didn't get in the way, and only sent a prompt if either required, or after a certain time delay.</p>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">User research showed that managing policies and personal information in this way would keep users invested in the app. By having a few simple questions being asked ocassionally, there will be a reduction on time sink filling out forms and micro managing a lot of information.</p>
