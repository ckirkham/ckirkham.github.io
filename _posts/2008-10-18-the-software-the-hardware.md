title: The Software, The Hardware
---

I know that *everyone* has done a post like this at some point, however I felt it would be good to share my viewpoint on the way in which I work, what tools I use and how I compose myself on a day to day basis. My thoughts are that it would be nice to help even one person to find something that they don't already use on a daily basis.

That said, there will be a lot here you hopefully recognise and should be using daily if you're a designer or a hacker. Regarding hardware, I've always tried to keep the amount of objects that I own (in general) down as I don't like owning a lot of stuff, [only things](http://www.raptitude.com/2011/01/i-dont-want-stuff-any-more-only-things/ "I Don't Want Stuff Any More, Only Things").

If I miss anything please let me know in the comments below! I'll also try and keep this article updated:

## Design
1. [Adobe CC](http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/creativecloud.html "Adobe Creative Cloud") – Needs no introduction, suffice to say that the Adobe suite has a lot of great design apps.
2. [Sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/ "Sketch") – I use this mainly for wire framing prototypes, but as a complex UI design tool when I'm doing a full design to front-end process myself.
4. FontCase (Recently culled) – The new [Fonts](http://bohemiancoding.com/fonts/ "Fonts") app looks interesting, but not very powerful yet.
5. [Skala Preview](http://bjango.com/mac/skalapreview/ "Skala Preview") – For previewing UI designs on the iPhone. This is extremely useful to keep open during the design process. 
6. [Composite](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/composite-prototyping-tool/id684454232?ls=1&mt=8 "Composite App") – Perfect for iPhone prototyping – very powerful app.

## Development
1. [Processing](http://processing.org "Processing development language") – Probably the most enjoyable programming language I've played with, and surprisingly simple to get to grips with. My article [I, Processing](http://ckirkham.com/blog/i-processing "I, Processing - Christian Kirkham") touches on this.
2. [Coda](http://panic.com/coda/ "Coda IDE") – [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com "Sublime Text") is great and all, but I personally enjoy working inside of Coda as an IDE more than other apps.
3. [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ "Xcode") – Endless possibilities for his application, to which I'm only just beginning to learn. There's a great article [here](http://blog.mengto.com/prototype-xcode-storyboard/ "Prototyping using Xcode") on prototyping using this great app.
4. [Quartz Composer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwobezAOnqk "Install Quartz Composer") – Another app I'm just touching the surface with, but one that ties very closely into Xcode. Great for prototyping, but the learning curve is quite steep.
5. [Codekit](http://incident57.com/codekit/ "CodeKit") – Keeps track of your development folders and compiles code on the fly. Perfect for use in tandem with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com "SASS") & [Compass](http://compass-style.org "Compass").
6. [Sequel Pro](http://www.sequelpro.com "Sequel Pro") – I don't actually use this application any more, but it's a really simple way of keeping track of databases in an application, as opposed to in a web browser using phpMyAdmin.
7. [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash "Dash app") – Indispensable application for storing snippets of code and development doc sets.

## Animation
1. [Adobe After Effects](http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/aftereffects.html "Adobe After Effects CC") – The best tool for motion graphics, especially combined with Cinema 4D
2. [Cinema 4D](http://www.maxon.net/products/cinema-4d-prime/ "Cinema 4D") – An application I'm still getting to grips with, but probably one of the most powerful apps for doing 3D development and animation.

## General
1. [1Password 4](https://agilebits.com/onepassword "1Password 4") – An invaluable app for storing logins, passwords, application codes & personas.
2. [Merlin](http://www.projectwizards.net/en/merlin/ "Merlin - task management") – Create detailed task and project plans with beautiful gantt charts!
3. [CleanMyMac](http://macpaw.com/cleanmymac "Clean My Mac 2") – Great for cleaning out redundant files, application leftovers, and large files throughout your computer. Also available for PC.
4. [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/uk/ "Spotify") – Unlimited music!
5. [Evernote](http://evernote.com "Evernote") – Invaluable for collecting 
6. [Caffeine](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/ "Caffeine") – A small app that keeps your computer awake so you can put it to sleep whenever you want to.
7. [Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/ "Things") – A to-do list app I've used for over 3 years now, and that no matter how many others I've tried, I always come back to.
9. [IA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/mac/ "IA Writer") – The best and most simple writing application for the macintosh.
