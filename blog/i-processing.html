		<h1>I, Processing</h1>

		<p>A new site and a new blog.  I'd like to talk you through a side project I started working on a few weeks ago; a scripting language called Processing.</p>

<p>Being a self-teacher for as long as I can remember, I'm constantly learning something new and working on different projects – I think in an industry that is changing every day, there's no better way to stay ahead of the curve and to remain inspired than to experience new technologies. So I've set out on a new learning obsession with the Processing scripting language and the freedom that it offers me to explore in my workflow.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Looking at the language</h2>

<p>Processing is an <a href="http://www.openprocessing.org">Open Source</a> visual scripting language, created to teach the fundamentals of computer programming concepts to people. John Resig wrote a brilliant summary <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/overview-of-processing/">article</a> on the subject and touches on the key principles and core concepts – give this a read if you've got time, it covers everything you need to know to get started.</p>

<p>For pure designers especially, the words "Open source", "Scripting language" and "computer programming" can be daunting and I think that's what puts most people off trying something new. Even if you're not a designer, a developer, etc, learning a computer language can be beneficial for a multitude of purposes; maybe you want to make that big app idea you've thought about, perhaps you want a new job in the myriad of new positions that have opened up in the digital space that are ever increasing, even if you just want to learn a new skill. Especially for the future generations, I can't see that this shit isn't going to be optional 10 years from now.</p>

<p>Why am I learning processing? Why not? Installations, Idea logging, artistic visions. Although daunting and quite a large task, the results can be astounding. Ultimately, I'd like to be able to present a new skill offering to the agency I work at – bringing an interactive element to our diverse skill set would be interesting to incorporate into our future projects.</p>

<p>Processing is a powerful programming tool – in comparison to hard core programming it is easier to pick up, and it helps beginner programmers to get started. This is due to the <a href="http://www.riverlogic.com/2011/02/the-demand-for-visual-feedback/">"instant feedback through interaction"</a> style that Processing is built around. Write a few lines of code.. hit play.. see your "bouncing ball" animation. This instant feedback is what helps it to appeal to beginners and novices alike, as the learning curve is lower, and the trial and error reduced, helping forego the frustration a lot of people arrive at when attempting to learn a programming language. Check out <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5053578/beautiful-visuals-created-using-the-processing-programming-language">this link</a> for a mesmerising example of what it can do. For more simplified examples visit <a href="http://www.openprocessing.org/browse/">Open Source Processing</a>, an incredible library full of other peoples processing code.</p>

<p>I'd also recommend the book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Learning-Processing-2-0-Programming-Interaction/dp/0123736021">"Learning Processing"</a> by Daniel Shiffman as it is an excellent read; simple to understand for a beginner, but getting into the grit of it quick enough for a more seasoned programmer. I'm following this book as I go and I'm finding it invaluable, and I think that it perfectly encapsulates the reasons and how to's for learning the language.</p>

<p><q>This book tells a story. It’s a story of liberation, of taking the first steps towards understanding the foundations of computing, writing your own code, and creating your own media without the bonds of existing software tools. This story is not reserved for computer scientists and engineers. This story is for you.</q></p>

<p>Watch this space and, along with other projects, I intend to log my progress with the Processing language, and hopefully craft something interesting, and possibly provide some tutorials on getting into the world of Processing.</p>
