	<p class="col-eight shift-two project-study-introduction">Case study of the Chemist Direct e-commerce site being re-built from the ground up for the responsive web, in a sprint led, agile workflow.</p>

	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>At <a href="http://www.albion.co">Albion</a> we worked collaboratively in house with the team at <a href="http://chemistdirect.co.uk">Chemist Direct</a> to re-architecture their outdated e-commcerce platform. The project took the course of 9 months to complete, where we worked on individual sprints focused on various sections of the site.</p>
	<p>Development was handled by our team and partly the clients team communicating under the same roof. Collaboration continued as the site was being developed to ensure bugs, errors and adaptations were handled gracefully.</p>

	<h2>UX Process</h2>
	<p>The project consisted of 5 sprints, running one after the other. The groups were kept as consistent as possible to minimize inconsistencies.</p>
	<p>Working collaboratively with the client consisted of morning stand-ups and weekly retrospectives to caveat any project holes that would develop and deal with any blockers.</p>
	<p>Wireframes were made of every page and iterated on constantly. From here we tested current low fidelity design builds with users. Users were gathered independantly of one another through an agency and incentivised to take part with a cash reward. Feedback was than collated, examined, and then the designs would be further iterated upon.</p>

	<p>As the design developed we had to begin documenting the interactions of the site. As we were working a staggered approach with the designers and the developers at different stages, it was crucial for the developers to be tackling one part of the site, whilst we would be designing and documenting the next.</p>
	<p>As we were working for a fully responsive build, interactions had to be documented for all breakpoints, which included various differences between device use cases and scenarios.</p>

	<h2>Visual Design &amp; Development</h2>
	<p>We used PhotoShop to design all of the visual design files, as this is what the whole of our team was using. This kept handover time to minimum as people had to leave and rejoin the project at various intervals.</p>

	<p>As the PSD files in breakpoints for 320px, 768px &amp; 960px were being created, we had to begin documenting the style guide and craft the guidelines for the developers to reference on a sprint by sprint basis.</p>
	<p>A large, single PSD file was used to collate all of the assets for the style guide (shown below). Layers were labelled accurately with sizes and sub-folders being important to present clarity to both the developers, and Chemist Directs in house designers.</p>
	<p>After the project was finished, their designers were to use this document in reference from the digital design guidelines (show below) to create any new assets for the platform.</p>

	<img class="col-six shift-end" src="/assets/images/work/chemistdirect/cd-designguidelines.jpg" />

	<p>The digital design guidelines were to be inserted into the brand guidelines that currently existed for the new Chemist Direct, which had also been designed by Albion.</p>
	<p>This document covered padding, margins, typography and image specifications to accurately recreate any scenarios within the designs, and also any future edge cases.</p>
