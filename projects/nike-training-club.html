	<p class="col-eight shift-two project-study-introduction">Working at <a href="http://www.akqa.com">AKQA</a>, I worked to rehaul the Nike Training experience. Our aim was to create a fitness experience for everybody, that can transcend cultures and guide users to greatness.</p>

	<p class="col-eight shift-two">With over 21 million downloads, the new Nike Training Club app has been a wild success. It is available in 19 languages in over 200 countries, and has 1.8 million active users, doing over 500,000 workouts per week.</p>

	<h2 class="col-eight shift-two">The Brief</h2>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">Launched in 2010, Nike Training Club for women exploded onto the scene by putting a personal trainer into every pocket. Beyond an app, a movement was born.</p>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">But with the shift in the training mindset, there was now demand to rebuild from the ground up.</p>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">With that in mind, AKQA were tasked with re-engineering the experience for both genders, and aligning with an emerging digital brand ecosystem.</p>

	<h2 class="col-ten shift-two">The Tools</h2>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">We used both digital and physical to solve problems with the NTC experience. Our main workflow tool go-to was <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a>. We used for everything from wireframing to artworking.</p>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">After approving files, we would use <a href="http://www.pixate.com/">Pixate (RIP)</a>, or <a href="https://www.flinto.com/">Flinto</a> to construct a prototype to show to the client. Then we would upload our designs to InVision for collaborative feedback. Finally, the files would their long journey in <a href="https://zeplin.io/">Zeplin</a>, where the developers could get the details of every pixel.</p>

	</section> -->
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">Towards the end of the process, I had the privilege to present the process of how we used tools in designing NTC 5.0 to the Sketch Community. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8OEFOb_tJYTTElxb2JfQUJ4bGM/view?usp=sharing">Download the presentation here.</a></p>

	<small class="col-twelve centralise">Your ultimate personal trainer. Get expert guidance, workouts you can do anywhere and the motivation.</small>

	<h2 class="col-eight shift-two">The Process</h2>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">Our process was ever changing. Sketch, guerilla test, design, prototype, refine, repeat. We worked in a lean and agile fashion. We flew to Portland, Oregon to work in the Nike campus with the clients quite often. We grew to understand the training culture that the app was born out of to help us better craft an experience suited to the people who were going to use it. I myself became an avid user of the app, hunting bugs and problems I might have using at home or in the gym.</p>
	<q class="col-eight shift-two">Greatest App I have ever used. Thanks to this app. I have dropped over 30 LBS in the last 6 months. I have no equipment, but this app doesn't allow that to be an excuse. Whether you have equipment or not, you can still workout and see results.
	<small class="quote-author">App store reviewer</small></q>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">We built a full-service test lab to mirror gym environments. We began recruitment drives and using prototypes of every fidelity, tested relentlessly, observing natural behaviours to identify problems and their patterns.</p>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">The process embraced failure. Starting over with a blank sheet of paper became a sign of progress.</p>

	<h2 class="col-eight shift-two">Wireframes</h2>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">We wireframed every screen and every detail in high fidelity. This helped us to see our designs as realistically as possible. Only at the end, after prototyping and approval from the client, would they be sent for artworking.</p>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">However, even after approval and artworking, we would iterate on the next version. This version may have been with the developers, but we were constantly improving the design patterns and language we had constructed, like it was a living, breathing thing. This influenced and aided many of the future features of the app.</p>

	<h2 class="col-seven">The 'Workout Plan'</h2>
	<section class="col-seven">
		<p>One of the most advanced and consistently refined experiences was 'The Plan'. This allowed users to create an intelligent system that guided them to workout at specific times of the work, and provided them the most apporopriate workout level and time for their preferences.</p>
		<p>We developed an adaptive training engine that learns from behaviour. Tell us how hard you pushed and we‚Äôll combine it with personal data, to give you training at the right intensity and focus, next time.</p>
		<p>Being such an advanced feature to integrate into an already quite fully-features app, this was on the most complex challenges we had to face.</p>
		<p>Eventually after much prototyping and testing, we had come up with a system that allowed users to create a plan suited to their needs and adhrered to their fitness goals.</p>

	<h2 class="col-eight shift-two">Nike Digital Architecture</h2>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">After all this refinement and crafting, we had created an experience language that could truly be called Nike. We did all of this work in collaboration with <a href="http://www.instrument.com/
">Instrument</a>, another agency in Portland, Oregon. Together we came up with a concept of a unified brand experience language for Nike.</p>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">One day soon ‚Äì This may become a reality.</p>

	<h2 class="col-eight shift-two">The ROI</h2>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">Training is life, not an hour in the gym. The app connects you with experts for advice, recommends product and drops community challenges. All personalised to the user.</p>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">With over 21 million downloads, the new Nike Training Club app has been a wild success. It is available in 19 languages in over 200 countries, and has 1.8 million active users, doing over 500,000 workouts per week.</p>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">Check out the app on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nike.ntc&amp;hl=en">Google App Store</a> and the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nike-training-club-workouts-fitness-plans/id301521403?mt=8">Apple App Store</a> and see for yourselves. ‚ò∫Ô∏è</p>
