	<h1 class="col-eight shift-two">Movements</h1>
	<h4 class="col-eight shift-two">User Experience, Prototyping, User Testing</h4>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two project-study-introduction">Movements is crowdsourcing human rights. It connects human rights activists in closed societies with those with skills to help them around the world.</p>

	<h2 class="col-eight shift-two">Overview</h2>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">Movements was a project initiated by <a href="http://advancinghumanrights.org">Advancing Human Rights</a> which we worked on full service from brand concept and ideation through to completion of a web app.</p>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">We worked with the developers at <a href="http://guerillasoftware.net">Guerilla Software</a> to create a complex  security dependant system, which was a great challenge, but one that has yielded a rewarding experience working with the Advancing Human Rights group.</p>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">Given a larger deadline, we would have had a chance to polish, along side the developers, the Movements.org platform and perfect their brand strategy.</p>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">Movements as a platform was recently picked up and mentioned as a force for good on both Al Jazeera and Fox news in America. See the 'Press' section below.</p>
	
	<h2 class="col-eight shift-two">Branding process</h2>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">The branding process was smooth, as the business had a clear message to convey, and their brand values were strong and well rounded. The team over at Advancing Human Rights were based in New York however, and this made collaboration more challenging.</p>
	
	<h3 class="col-eight shift-two">Logo</h3>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">The logo represents the contacting force of a pendulum ball swinging to hit the remaining pendulum balls. The resulting force causes a 'movement' inspiring change in others.</p>
	
	<img class="col-four shift-one" src="/assets/images/work/movements/movements-logo.jpg" />
	<img class="col-five shift-one" src="/assets/images/work/movements/movements-iconography.jpg" />
	
	<h2 class="col-eight shift-two">UX Process</h2>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">Security was a serious issue we to had to address, and one of the main features of the service. After analysing similar and competing applications, along with secure authenticated systems, and sitting down with the developers at Guerilla Software, we came up with a multi-tiered login system.</p>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">We could not allow compromising data transfer between users, therefore the tiered account system worked best for the problem. From there, users have the ability to invite and vouch for other users, and administrators can vet applicants and give them certain access to view on the site.</p>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">Usability testing was conducted on wireframes and prototypes we created in low fidelity. The wireframes were then iterated upon, and the visual designs amended as we improved the structure of the site from testing.</p>
	
	<img class="img-pull" src="/assets/images/work/movements/movements-sketches.jpg" />
	<small>Countless wireframes covering Desktop and Mobile were constructed and put in front of users for testing.</small>

	<h2 class="col-eight shift-two">UI Design</h2>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">Interface design was visually kept consistent with the brand language. Muted tones of the brand colour system were integrated into the framework of the site. Accented colours for Calls to Action and important blocks of content.</p>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">Icons played an important part of the interface. Due to the site being developed for multiple languages, we had to create an icon set that was as recognisable as possible to avoid being ambigious.</p>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">Responsive designs (fluid, down to tablet and mobile) were designed later, as these were not priority for release based on the target audience.</p>
	
	<img class="img-pull" src="/assets/images/work/movements/movements-screens.jpg" />

	<h2 class="col-eight shift-two">Press</h2>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">In the news, Movements was picked up by <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/10/new-web-platform-crowdsources-human-rights.html">The Daily Beast</a>, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/natan-sharansky-marshaling-the-web-to-fight-tyrants-1405552445">The Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kZgFBsoI34">Fox</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NO7j7sPpNg">Al Jazeera</a> for it's benefit to humanity as an online tool.</p>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">The service has been hailed for by it's creator <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Keyes">David Keyes</a> who is the Executive Director of the company <a href="www.advancinghumanrights.org/">Advancing Human Rights</a></p>

	<h2 class="col-eight shift-two">Movements</h2>
	<p class="col-eight shift-two">The Movements platform is available and free to use.</p>
